# Waste-management-analysis-and-machine-learning
This project uses machine learning, multiple linear regression to create a predictive model for ai implementation in smart cities  
Methodology  
This research examines the impact of AI-related factors on waste management efficiency in urban areas, using Recycling Rate (%) as a proxy for overall efficiency. The study analyzes the data set also uses machine  
 learning approaches to predict efficiency and identify influential variables across socio-environmental and operational dimensions.  
Dataset Description  
The dataset includes 850 records across multiple years (2019–2023) from cities in India, focusing on the target variable, Recycling rate (%) and other features which include:  
•	Waste generated per day  
•	Population density  
•	Municipal efficiency score  
•	Cost of waste management  
•	Awareness campaign counts  
•	Disposal methods  
•	Landfill capacity and locations  
•	Year  

Discussion  
Interpretation of Key Findings  
1.	Weak Model Performance (R² = 0.0037):  
o	The extremely low R² value suggests the current linear model fails to capture meaningful relationships  
o	Potential explanations:  
	Non-linear relationships between variables
	Omission of critical predictive features (e.g., actual AI implementation levels)  
	Data quality issues in efficiency scoring  
2.	Counterintuitive Findings:  
o	Municipal Efficiency Score: The negative coefficient (-0.196) contradicts expectations  
	Possible data reporting inconsistencies  
	Potential reverse causality (higher recycling rates may lead to stricter scoring)  
o	Awareness Campaigns: Negative impact suggests either:  
	Campaigns are ineffective in current form  
	Data doesn't capture campaign quality/implementation  
3.	Policy-Relevant Insights:  
o	The slight positive effect of cost (3.15e-04) implies investment may yield marginal improvements  
o	Population density's minimal impact suggests urban/rural differences may not be a primary driver  
  
Limitations  
•	Data Constraints: Lack of direct AI implementation metrics  
•	Model Specification: Linear assumptions may be inappropriate  
•	Temporal Factors: Cross-sectional data ignores time-dependent effects  
Recommendations for Future Research  
1.	Enhanced Data Collection:  
o	Incorporate actual AI adoption metrics
o	Include qualitative assessments of campaign effectiveness  
2.	Model Improvements:  
o	Test non-linear and ensemble methods  
o	Implement feature engineering to capture interactions  
3.	Policy Implications:  
o	Re-evaluate municipal efficiency scoring methodology  
o	Investigate awareness campaign implementation quality  
  
iii.	Random Forest Model  
Metric	Value  
MSE	295.70  
R² Score	-0.067  

Refined Random Forest Regression Results:  
•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 14.80 (slightly improved)  
•	Mean Squared Error (MSE): 295.70 (minor improvement)  
•	R² Score: -0.067 (still low, but slightly better)  
  
Key Observations  
Removing the least significant feature made a slight improvement but did not significantly enhance the predictive power.  
The negative R² score still suggests that the model is not well-fitted to the data.  
  
Adoption of AI-Specific features by synthetic generation  
To improve the model, we can introduce AI-specific features such as:  
  
•	AI Waste Sorting Accuracy (%) – Measures how accurately AI identifies and sorts waste.  
  
•	Smart Bin Adoption Rate (%) – Percentage of smart bins deployed in the city.  

•	AI Waste Logistics Optimization (%) – Reduction in transportation costs/distance due to AI.  
  
AI-Enhanced Random Forest Regression Results  
•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 14.70 (slight improvement)  
•	Mean Squared Error (MSE): 292.51 (small reduction)  
  
•	R² Score: -0.056 (still negative but improving)  
  
Key Takeaways  
•	Adding AI-related features slightly improved the model.  
•	The model is still underperforming, likely due to: Limited dataset size, High variance in the data  
  
AI-Enhanced Feature Importance Analysis  
•	Cost of Waste Management (17.29%) – Still the most influential factor.  
  
•	Smart Bin Adoption Rate (16.63%) – AI-based waste management is making an impact.  

•	AI Waste Sorting Accuracy (15.79%) – High sorting accuracy improves efficiency.  

•	AI Waste Logistics Optimization (15.37%) – AI reduces waste transport costs and distance.  

•	Waste Generated per Day (13.67%) – Still a significant predictor.  

•	Population Density (11.58%) – Moderate influence.  
   
•	Awareness Campaigns (9.67%) – Least impact among selected features.  

Key Insights  
•	AI-driven factors now account for nearly 50% of the total importance, showing that AI integration is improving waste management predictions  

•	Smart Bin Adoption Rate and AI Sorting Accuracy are nearly as influential as traditional cost factors.    

•	Awareness Campaigns have the least impact, suggesting that policy-based changes alone may not be enough.
